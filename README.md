## Introduction

[ClamAV®](https://www.clamav.net/) is an open-source antivirus engine for detecting trojans, viruses, malware & other malicious threats.

This add-on allows you to run [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) through the DDEV web service.
The Docker image used is [clamav/clamav-debian:1.5.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/clamav/clamav-debian) (multi-arch: amd64, arm64, ppc64le), so it works on Apple Silicon and other ARM64 hosts as well as x86_64.

## Getting Started

Install the DDEV ClamAV:

For DDEV v1.23.5 or above run

```shell
ddev add-on get fwust/ddev-clamav
```

For earlier versions of DDEV run

```shell
ddev get fwust/ddev-clamav
```

Then restart your project.

```shell
ddev restart
```
